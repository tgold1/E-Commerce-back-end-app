# E-Commerce-back-end-app

## Description
The idea of this project was to maximize the link between sequalize and the mySQL shell. The reason I wanted to do this so there could be an e-commerce back end server that could store product, category, and tag data making it easy to use for any e-commerce business. This is building the connection between the front end and the back end able to improve database storage and update, delete, and create new product data. I learned how to navigate between sequalize and mySQL as well as experience testing routes in Insomnia.

## Installation 
You will need to create a .env file to store the database, user, and your mySQL password. Then you need to seed your data by issuing the seeds/index.js command from the command line in your terminal. Now the data is seeded you then issue the node server.js command on the command line in the terminal. You should receive an App is listening on port 3001! Now you are ready to test your routes in Insomnia.

## Usage
There are multiple steps and I have provided a walkthrough video of how to use this application. Do not forget to start with the .env file which is abbreviated for an environment variable file. This is a crucial step to be able to use this application. Here is the link to the walkthrough video:
